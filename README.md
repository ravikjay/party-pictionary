## The Game
Party Pictionary takes the popular party game "Pictionary" and puts it in the convenience of your mobile devices. No board games, paper, or markers required!

Players (4+) split up into two teams. Each team will have 1 artist, who must draw the word that the see on the screen. 

The other players on the team will see the drawing reflected real-time onto another device, from which they can identify and guess words from their teammates' drawings.

Whoever's team can guess the most words right in a certain time period, wins!
